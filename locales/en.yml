      img_guid_capacity_mutually_exclusive: |-
        The disk capacity can only be specified when using an operating
        system reference code and not when using a specific compute or
        flex image guid. Please use one of the following options in the
        provider section:

        config.vm.provider :softlayer do |sl|
          sl.image_guid = "AAAAAAAA-BBBB-CCCC-DDDD-EEEEEEEEEEEE"
        end

        config.vm.provider :softlayer do |sl|
          sl.operating_system = "UBUNTU_LATEST"

          # Disk number 1 is reserved for SWAP space, see SoftLayer API
          # CLI tool command 'sl cci create-options' for more info.
          sl.disk_capacity = { 0 => 25, 2 => 100, 3 => 2000 }
        end
      img_guid_os_code_mutually_exclusive: |-
        The image guid for a compute or flex image and the operating
        system reference code cannot be used at the same time.

          sl.image_guid = "AAAAAAAA-BBBB-CCCC-DDDD-EEEEEEEEEEEE"
        end

        config.vm.provider :softlayer do |sl|

        end
      lb_duplicate: |-
        A load balancer service group has been specified multiple
        times. Only one directive for any { :vip, :port } combination
        is allowed.
      lb_port_vip_required: |-
        For joining a load balancer, you need to specify at least
        virtual IP address, virtual server port and destination
        port in the provider section of the Vagrantfile:

        config.vm.provider :softlayer do |sl|
          sl.join_load_balancer :port => 443, :vip => "1.1.1.1" do |service|
            service.destination_port = 443
          end
        end
      ssh_key_required: |-
        At least an SSH key for the instance is required.
        Please specify it, either using name or id, in the
        provider section of the Vagrantfile:

        config.vm.provider :softlayer do |sl|
          sl.ssh_key = 1
        end
      username_required: |-
        The SoftLayer username is required. Please specify it
        using the SL_USERNAME environment variable or in the provider
        section of the Vagrantfile:

        config.vm.provider :softlayer do |sl|
          sl.username = "my_username"
        end
    errors:
      api_error: |-
        Vagrant returned an exception while calling the SoftLayer API.

        Exception class: %{class}
        Exception message: %{message}
      certificate_error: |-
        The secure connection to the SoftLayer API has failed. This is
        generally caused by the OpenSSL configuration associated with
        the Ruby install being unaware of the system specific CA certs.

        Please ensure that the SSL_CERT_FILE environment variable is set
        with a path to a certificate authority.

        Linux example:

        export SSL_CERT_FILE=/opt/vagrant/embedded/cacert.pem

        Mac OS X example:

        export SSL_CERT_FILE=/Applications/Vagrant/embedded/cacert.pem

        Windows example:

        set SSL_CERT_FILE=C:\HashiCorp\Vagrant\embedded\cacert.pem
